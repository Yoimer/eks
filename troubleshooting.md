[EXPLANATION COMES HERE]

## Step 1: Inspect the Container Image Locally

Since the container failed due to missing host mounts, we need to inspect the image directly to verify its contents and ensure it includes the necessary binaries (`ls`, `cat`, `curl`, etc.).

Run the following command to start an interactive shell inside the container without attempting to execute any commands:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh 602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-k8s-cni:v1.19.2-eksbuild.5
```

Once inside the container, check the `$PATH` variable and verify whether common binaries are available:

```bash
echo $PATH
which ls cat curl printenv
```

## What to Expect

1. If the binaries (`ls`, `cat`, `curl`, etc.) are present, this confirms that the container image is correctly built and includes the necessary tools.
2. If the binaries are missing, this indicates that the container image is incomplete or misconfigured.

Here is the output if the suggested command.

```bash 
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh 602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-k8s-cni:v1.19.2-eksbuild.5  
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "sh": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown  
Run 'docker run --help' for more information
```

The error message indicates that the `sh` shell is not available in the container image. This suggests that the container image is built with a minimal environment and does not include common shells like `sh` or `bash`. However, we can still inspect the contents of the image by using alternative methods.

  ## Key Observations

1. **Readiness Probe Failures**  
   - Repeated readiness probe failures with the error:  
     `timeout: failed to connect service ":50051" within 5s`.  
   - Indicates the `aws-node` container cannot connect to the gRPC service on port `50051`.  

2. **Liveness Probe Failure**  
   - After multiple readiness failures, the liveness probe also failed with the same error.  
   - Resulted in the `kubelet` restarting the `aws-node` container.  

3. **Pod Status**  
   - The pod remained in a `1/2` state (one container not ready).  
   - The `aws-node` container failed, while the `aws-eks-nodeagent` container ran successfully.

This output clearly shows the sequence of events leading to the `1/2` status and highlights the root cause: the inability of the `aws-node` container to connect to the gRPC service on port `50051`.
